# MaidSim

This is a small project in Java in which I want to create a game where you take up the role of a girl in financial distress resorting to taking up a job as the headmaid for a wealthy mansion owner. My initial plan is to make a game which gives you a fair amount of freedom with little to none obligatory quests. The game will include elements such as Kemonomimi, other half-humans and fantasy races, futanari, pregnancy (and lactation), transformations (which means that if everything works out, you can become a catgirl even though you started of as a pure human)
